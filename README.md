- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Arthur-Butler
I am a Cape Town based developer that has been in the industry in different roles mostly full-stack for 4 years now. My passion for all things computers and IT started
at a very young age and I have since grown a sizeable knowledge base since then. I have worked with multiple programming languages and frameworks. I have utilized my 
skills on multiple projects both for personal use and for business clients. After high school I was accepted into the Cape Innovation and Technology Initiative start up.
Over my year with them I coded in mostly HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python and won a hackathon by coding the backend python controls for a mine detector robot. The next year I 
interned at Younglings where I worked on multiple projects for clients and won another hackathon for my Devhelp application at the end of my year there. After that I 
worked on contract at Monzamedia where over my 5 months there I constructed a search engine, a Whatsapp and Gmail powered chatbot, integrated a Payflex payment system 
and added social media login buttons to key websites. While working with Monzamedia I coded in PHP and a framework called Laravel. You will find that I am a hard 
working, diligent individual that strives to complete tasks to the best of my ability. I have always loved complexed logical problems that I can muse over and solve. 
My interests are emerging technologies such as ray tracing, quantum supremacy, VR, AI and micro-computing. My ultimate goal is to become a Senior back-end or full-stack
developer.
